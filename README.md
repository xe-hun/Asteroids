# Asteroid-Inspired Game

This repository contains the source code for a Python game, a personal spin-off inspired by the classic Asteroids. It's built entirely using Python and the Pygame library, without relying on any higher-level game engines built on top of Pygame.

## About

This project was a fun and engaging coding experience for me. I embarked on it with no specific end goal in mind, simply wanting to explore and create. The process allowed me to encounter and solve numerous interesting and unique challenges. I'm genuinely surprised and pleased with how far the game has progressed.

My primary hobby is problem-solving, and I find coding to be an excellent outlet for this passion. Creating something tangible through code is incredibly rewarding. This project reflects that passion, and I'm eager to continue improving my skills and tackling new challenges.

## Features

* **Classic Asteroids Inspiration:** The game draws inspiration from the timeless gameplay of Asteroids, with my own twist.
